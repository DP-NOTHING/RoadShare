"Fuel the Ride, Divide with Pride"

The problem RoadShare solves
Picture this: Traveling with friends in your car, you want to be generous and skip charging them for the trip. But you still want to split the fuel cost fairly. With our app, just input trip details to estimate costs. Then, divide the fuel expenses among friends accurately. Everyone contributes, no one feels unfairly burdened. Even if you drop off a friend at an earlier destination, the app ensures they pay only their fair share of the fuel costs.

Picture this: Traveling in an unknown area, you hop into a rickshaw with no meter. No worries. With our app, you can quickly estimate your trip cost based on distance and local rates. With this info, you negotiate fair pricing or choose a fair rate, ensuring you're never overcharged.

Picture this: You lend your car to your friend for a day trip. As the day ends, they're unsure how much fuel they used. With our tool, they enter trip details, get an estimate, and fill up just right. They return your car with confidence, being a sweet friend and a responsible borrower.
